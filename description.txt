Reduces the time needed to use permanent consumables.

This mod does the following:
- Accelerates the usage of certain items to 6 Frames (i.e. will use an item 10 times per second at 60 FPS)
- Enables auto-use of certain items

This mod affects the following items:
- Life Crystal
- Life Fruit
- Mana Crystal

Additional configuration options allow the user to change the usage time to their liking, as well as disable sound of affected items once the sound becomes too uncomfortable to listen to at lower usage times.

This mod is primarily aimed at people who are getting tired of constantly having to click and wait for the game to use all their permanent consumables or those, who have some form of infinite permanent consumable mod (such as yours truly).

I'm not planning on adding more to this mod except for any new vanilla permanent consumables, which can be used multiple times the same way a Life Crystal can be used multiple times. Compatibility with other mods' perma consumables also isn't planned. I *might* add a new config option in which users are able to select any additional items which they want to be affected by the above but it'll be a while until then as I still have real life to deal with.

This mods source code is available over on GitHub, which is linked below, in case you want to take a look at it.
